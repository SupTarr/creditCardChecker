# Credit Card Checker

## About The Project

This project was completed as part of `Codecademy's Career Path - Front-End Engineer`. In this project, the company that you work for suspects that `credit card` distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. You have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid.

Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of `functions` and `loops` to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!
